# Introduction to Connected Devices - Final Project

## Spring 2023

## **Goals**

The Final Project will demonstrate understanding of the material and technologies from this semesterâ€™s lectures and assignments, and your ability to solve real-world problems using them, by building something novel.

## Format

* 1 or 2 students per team 
* must submit **project proposal _and have proposal approved_**
* provide a **midpoint proof-of-feasibility** in-class demonstration
* work must be completed in order to present and turn in final deliverables during **Finals Week** 

## Important Dates

* Initial Proposal Due: **March 22, 2023**
* Feedback Back from Instructor on Proposal By: **March 29, 2023**
* Final Proposal Due: **April 3, 2023**
* Midpoint Proof-Of-Feasibility Due:  **April 19 2023**
* Final Presentation and Submission Due: **May 4, 20232**

## Project Proposal
* The proposed project must be _novel_ and _challenging_ for students of the course
* The proposed project must be a _technical_ project, involving **one or more LAMPI devices** and **at least two** of the following:
    * Touchscreen (Kivy)
    * Pub/Sub (MQTT)
    * AWS
    * Web (HTML/CSS/JS/Websockets)
    * Django
    * Mobile (iOS)
    * Bluetooth Low Energy
    * Analytics
    * Secure, Remote Firmware Update
    * Load Testing and Scaling
    * Security
    * DevOps (Ansible)
    * (other - but only with strong justification and instructor approval)
* (see proposal format below)

## Deliverables

1. Project Proposal (1-2 pages) required sections
    * **Project Title**
    * **Names of Team Member(s)**
    * **Project Description** (3-4 paragraphs, _will almost certainly have one or more images/figures - block diagram, state machine, etc._)
    * **Scope** - what is in scope?  what is out of scope?
    * **Learning Goals** - what do you hope to learn from completing this project?
    * **Hardware and Software Required** (particularly what do you need that you don't already have access to) 
    * **Project Plan** - Briefly describe your project plan (key tasks, milestones, etc.), including a minimal "walking skeleton"
    * **Risks and Mitigation Plan**
    * **Midpoint** - Proof of Feasiblity
        * What is a "walking skeleton" of minimal functionality to prove out the feasibility of your project that can be completed in a few weeks (this is a form of derisking)?
2. Midpoint Demo (Proof of Feasibliity) required sections
    * **Report** (1-2 pages; what worked, what did not, what do you need to do differently to finish the project)
    * **Demo Video** ( ~1 minute)
    * **Brief in-class presentation and demonstration** (<5 minutes; slides if appropriate)
3. Final 
    * Final Report (2-3 pages; longer if data/reports/etc.) required sections
        * **Title**
        * **Team Members**
        * **Project Description**
        * **Project Plan**
        * **Process/Methods**(What did you do?)
        * **Results** (What did you accomplish? if not the complete goal, why not?)
        * **Conclusions** (What did you learn?)
    * **Slides** (PDF, PPTX, Google Slides)
    * **Presentation and Demo** (5-10 minutes) - all team members must be present and actively participate
    * **Demonstration Video**
    * **Code Submission** (Git Pull Request)

## Sample Project Ideas

* Alexa Integration
* Google Home Integration
* IFTTT Integration
* Direct Voice Integration
* [Digital Twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin)
* [AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/)
* LAMPI-LAMPI interactions (e.g., gaming, chat)
* Build a Lower-Cost LAMPI (e.g., Pi Zero W, ESP8266, etc.) that is compatible with current system
* [Enchanted Objects Concepts](https://enchantedobjects.com)
* New for 2023 (if you have something truly novel, go ahead and try pitching it)
	* no LAMPI Spotify projects
	* no LAMPI weather apps
	* no LAMPI alarm clocks

The instructor can lend hardware in some cases; if your project idea will be improved by specific hardware, please ask.

## Grading

The Final Project Grade will make up **10%** of your final grade.

The Final Project Grade will be based on the following components:

| Component | Final Project Weighting | Final Grade Percentage |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| Proposal  |    10%    | 1% |
| Mid-Point Report & Video | 20% | 2% |
| Final Presentation, Report, and Submission | 70% | 7% |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | **10%** | 

### Grading - Proposal

Will be based on final proposal submission.

| Component | Points Possible | Awarded | Description |
| --------- | --------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Formatting | 25             |         | Contains all required sections; professionally written.
| Technical Plan | 75        |         |  Clear technical plan, including a midpoint deliverable and plan for; appropriate scoping; discusses risks and possible mitigation |      
| **TOTAL** | **100** | 

### Grading - Midpoint Report and Demo Video

| Component | Points Possible | Awarded | Low | Medium | High |
| --------- | --------------- | ------- | --- | ------ | ---- |
| Written Communication | 20 | | Overly brief, poorly organized, poorly written report with many spelling and grammar issues | Report mostly organized and clear, with some areas hard to follow; few spelling/grammatical errors | Well structured, clear, concise report; few, if any spelling/grammatical errors |
| Demonstration / Problem Solving| 50 | | Poor demonstration of the project; nothing works, and students are unable to debug/fix | Demonstration mostly works and meets proposal Midpoint feasibility plan, but with some issues (e.g., reboots, long delays) | Flawless demonstration and meetgs Midpoint feasibility plan - student(s) clearly prepared and practised, and had anticipated contingencies |
| Plan for completion | 30 | | Student(s) are clueless | Student(s) have a pretty well thought out plan to finish | Student(s) have clearly anticipated issues that need to be addressed to complete project and have a clear plan to finish |
| **TOTAL** | **100** | 


### Grading - Final Presentation, Report, and Submission

| Component | Points Possible | Awarded | Low | Medium | High |
| --------- | --------------- | ------- | --- | ------ | ---- |
| Written Communication | 15 | | Overly brief, poorly organized, poorly written final report with many spelling and grammar issues | Final report mostly organized and clear, with some areas hard to follow; few spelling/grammatical errors | Well structured, clear, concise final report; few, if any spelling/grammatical errors |
| Presentation | 15 | | Slides contain errors and are poorly formatted; speakers inaudible; rely heavily on notes; unable to answer questions | Slides are mostly clear; speakers are mostly audible, with some use of notes; reasonable answers to most questions, but not all | Slides are error-free and logical; speakers are clear, audible, and fluent in their topic areas, and handle questions appropriately | 
| Demonstration | 20 | | Poor demonstration of the project; nothing works, and students are unable to debug/fix | Demonstration mostly works, but with some issues (e.g., reboots, long delays) | Flawless demonstration - student(s) clearly prepared and practised, and had anticipated contingencies |
| Problem Solving | 50 | | Student(s) completed little, if any of the project as outlined in the proposal | Student(s) completed most of the project as outlined in the proposal | Students completed the entire project as outlined in the proposal and demonstrated mastery of the topics |
| **TOTAL** | **100** |
